## 奖励积分

你是否通过了测试并且代码干净了?如果您愿意,可以尝试以下一些额外的事情:

-   尽可能多地删除重复.
-   优化可读性,即使它意味着引入重复.
-   如果您删除了所有重复项,那么您是否有很多条件?如果它适用于这种语言,请尝试用多态替换条件.它的可读性如何?

那么请在提交的评论中分享您的想法.这个实验是否使代码更好?更差?你从中学到了什么吗?

## 锈蚀安装

参考[运动帮助页面][help-page]用于Rust安装和学习资源.

## 编写代码

执行测试:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

除了第一次测试外,所有测试都被忽略了在第一个测试通过后,打开位于的测试源文件`tests`目录并删除`#[ignore]`从下一次测试中标记并再次通过测试.每个单独的测试都是一个函数`#[test]`它上面的旗帜.继续,直到通过每个测试.

如果您希望在不编辑测试源文件的情况下运行所有​​测试,请使用:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

例如,运行特定测试`some_test`, 您可以使用:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

如果忽略特定测试,请使用:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```
