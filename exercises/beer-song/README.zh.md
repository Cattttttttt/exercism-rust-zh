## 奖励积分

你是否通过了测试，并且代码干净了? 如果您愿意,可以尝试以下加分项:

-   尽可能多地删除重复.
-   优化可读性,即使它意味着引入重复.
-   如果您删除了所有重复项,那么您是否有很多条件? 如果它适用于这种语言,请尝试用多态替换条件语句。它的可读性如何?

那么请在提交的评论中，分享您的想法.这个实验是否让代码更好? 更差?你从中学到了什么?

## Rust装置

参考[我们的帮助页面][help-page]的Rust安装和学习资源.

## 编写代码

用下列方法执行测试:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

除了第一次测试外,所有的测试都被忽略了。在获得第一个测试通过后,打开位于`tests`目录和，在下一个测试标志删除`#[ignore]`,并使测试再次通过。每个单独的测试都是一个函数.`#[test]`标志在上面。继续,直到你通过每一个测试.

如果希望在不编辑测试源文件的情况下，运行所有测试,请使用:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

运行特定的测试,例如`some_test`,您可以使用:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

如果忽略特定测试,则使用:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```
