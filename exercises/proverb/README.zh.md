# 谚语

因为没有马蹄钉,一个王国就消失了,或者俗话说.

给出一个输入列表,生成相关的谚语.例如,

- 给定列表`["nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom"]`
- 你将输出这个谚语的全文:

```text
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
```

请注意,输入列表可能会有所不同; 您的解决方案应该能够处理**任意长度和内容**的列表。输出文本的行不应该是**静态的、不变的**字符串;
所有的都应该根据给定的输入而变化.
